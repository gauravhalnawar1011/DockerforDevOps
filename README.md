# Docker Installation Guide for Ubuntu OS

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install Docker on Ubuntu OS. Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu system (We recommend using the latest LTS version)
- A user account with `sudo` privileges
- For the official installation commands and more detailed instructions, visit the Docker documentation at [Docker Engine documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

## Step 1: Update Your System for Ubuntu

Before installing Docker, it's a good idea to update your package index and upgrade your system to ensure you have the latest versions of all your software.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Install Using the Apt Repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

### Set Up the Repository

1. Add Docker's official GPG key:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    ```

2. Add the Docker repository to Apt sources:

    ```bash
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

## Install Docker Engine

To install the latest version of Docker Engine, along with the docker-buildx-plugin and docker-compose-plugin, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

## Verify Docker Engine Installation

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your Ubuntu system. You're now ready to begin using Docker to manage your containers.
```
